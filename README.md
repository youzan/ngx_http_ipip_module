How-To-Use
----------------
Set the nginx config for ngx_http_ipip_module as the following:

```bash
http {
    ipip_ip_datx /xx/real_ip.datx;
    ipip_phone_txt /xx/real_phone.txt;

    server {
        listen 1999;

        location / {
                ipip on;
        }
    }
}
```

now you can get the ip info as the following:

```bash
[root@localhost ~]# curl "http://127.0.0.1:1999/ip?ip=8.8.8.8"
{
    "ret":  "ok",
    "data": ["GOOGLE", "GOOGLE", "", "google.com", "level3.com", "", "", "", "", "", "", "*", "*"]
}
```
or you can get the phone info as the following:

```bash
[root@localhost ~]# curl "http://127.0.0.1:1999/phone?phone=13000000101"
{
    "ret":  "ok",
    "data": ["北京", "北京", "中国联通网络"]
}
```

How-To-Autoupdate
----------------

According the check-version api of [ipip], we can check the ip and phone version automaticly. We're recommanded to use crontab to autoupdate as the following:

```bash
1 3 * * * xx flock -n /xx/ipip.lock /path/to/ngx_http_ipip_module/scripts/autoupdate.sh &> /data/logs/ipinfo.log
```

By the way, you must set the private data which is the token on [ipip] to the scripts/var file as the following:

```bash
export IPTOKEN=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
export PHONETOKEN=bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
export PATH=/opt/nginx/sbin:$PATH
```

Also you can rewrite the autoupdate.sh to suit for yourself. And the `fake_ip.datx` and `fake_phone.txt` are the fake file in order to run tests (we are recommanded to buy the service from ipip for getting the real file).
